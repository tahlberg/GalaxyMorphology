# GalaxyMorphologyProject
Final Project for CSC 180

We were given free reign to choose a data set and objective.
The goal of this project was to compare multiple transfer learning models against my own convolutional neural network to determine their effectiveness when identifying galaxy morphology.
The results include a comparison of the various transfer learning models in their ability to identify galaxies.

A revised version of this model would include improved image preprocessing such as normalizing rotation as well as producing confusion matrices for each network.
